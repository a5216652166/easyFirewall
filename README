Installation
============
You need a recent Linux 2.4 kernel with iptables activated (as module).

untar the packet in /etc
tar xzvf plffw-*.tar.gz -C /etc

jump into the new dir
cd /etc/firewall

copy init-script into your init dir
vi /etc/init.d/firewall
/etc/firewall/firewall.sh start
# chmod a+x firewall
cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
ln -s ../init.d/firewall ./S60firewall

now you should first configure it bevor you link it into a auto-startup

Configuration
=============

After that you could give take a first try with youir policy. Enter
"/etc/init.d/firewall test"

This will start the rules for 30 seconds, if everything is ok you can start
it after that steady.
"/etc/init.d/firewall start"

To start the firewall also on system-boot put a link into the appropriate
rc.d (eg. into /etc/rcS.d bevor the networking comes up)

The tracker.pl script is nice alternative for "cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack"
which shows the actual connection table.


at last ,you could read the rule_d/sample ,need some help depond it

Have fun !
